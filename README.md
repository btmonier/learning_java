# Learn Java

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to housing various lesson plans used for teaching individuals core Java concepts for certification purposes. Each "lesson" is broken into subsequent sub-directories and numerically tagged for chronological purposes.

## Getting started
If you do plan to follow this course, I would recommend you use IntelliJ for your IDE. It is developed by JetBrains and has tons of features to make your Java experience less excruciating. Hopefully you have a machine with _at least_ 8 GB of memory.
